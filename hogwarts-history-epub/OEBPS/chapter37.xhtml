  <h2>Wars and Hogwarts</h2>

  <p class="first">Hogwarts has existed through every major conflict in magical Britain's history and has been touched, directly or indirectly, by all of them. The school's responses to wartime conditions have varied considerably depending on the nature of the conflict, the position of the headmaster, and the broader political context. These responses illuminate both the school's values and its vulnerabilities, its capacity for resistance and its susceptibility to compromise.</p>

  <p>The rise of Gellert Grindelwald in the 1920s and 1930s presented Hogwarts with a challenge it had never before faced: an ideological movement that claimed to speak for wizarding interests while pursuing goals deeply at odds with the school's founding mission. Grindelwald's vision of magical supremacy, of wizard rule over Muggles achieved through any means necessary, attracted adherents throughout Europe and found sympathisers even within Britain's magical community. How Hogwarts should respond to this movement, whether to take a political stance or to maintain institutional neutrality, was hotly debated within the school's governance structures.</p>

  <p>The impact on international students and staff was immediate and significant. Students from countries affected by Grindelwald's activities faced difficult choices: return home to uncertain conditions or remain at Hogwarts, separated from their families. Several faculty members with continental connections departed, some to fight against Grindelwald and others, it was later discovered, to join him. The school's international exchange programs were suspended and would not resume for decades. Hogwarts became, for a time, a more insular institution than it had been for centuries.</p>

  <p>Hogwarts as symbol and potential target occupied considerable attention during the Grindelwald years. The school represented everything the dark wizard claimed to oppose: an institution that educated all magical children regardless of blood status, that preserved traditions incompatible with his ideology, that produced witches and wizards capable of opposing him. Whether Grindelwald ever seriously planned to attack Hogwarts is uncertain; the school's defences were formidable, and an assault would have diverted resources from his primary objectives. But the possibility was taken seriously. Defensive preparations were enhanced; evacuation plans were developed; emergency protocols were refined.</p>

  <p>How the castle weathered dark times depended significantly on the leadership of the headmaster. During the Grindelwald era, Headmaster Dippet pursued a policy of cautious neutrality, maintaining normal school operations while avoiding statements that might be construed as political. This approach has been criticised as inadequate to the moment, insufficiently committed to the values the school supposedly represented. It has also been defended as prudent, protecting the school from involvement in a conflict whose outcome was uncertain. The debate continues; reasonable people disagree.</p>

  <p>Teaching during wartime adapted to changed circumstances. Practical defensive magic received greater emphasis. History of Magic lessons incorporated discussion of previous dark wizard movements and how they had been defeated. Students were encouraged to develop skills that might prove useful if the conflict came to Britain. These adaptations were unofficial, implemented by individual teachers rather than mandated by policy, but they were widespread enough to suggest a common understanding of what students needed to learn.</p>

  <p>Student losses and memorials mark the periods when war touched Hogwarts most directly. The memorial in the entrance hall, added after Grindelwald's defeat, commemorates students and alumni who died in the struggle against him. The names are many; the losses were significant. Similar memorials from earlier conflicts dot the castle, quiet reminders of the price paid by previous generations. These memorials serve educational as well as commemorative purposes, reminding current students that the security they enjoy was purchased with blood.</p>

  <p>Hogwarts' role in eventual victory over Grindelwald remains debated. The school did not participate directly in the military campaign that ended with Grindelwald's defeat. But it educated the witches and wizards who did participate, prepared them with skills and values that informed their resistance, and preserved a vision of magical society fundamentally different from what Grindelwald offered. This contribution was indirect but real. The school survived the war. Its students, carrying what they had learned within its walls, helped ensure that the war was won.</p>

  <p>Lessons for future dark times have been drawn from the Grindelwald era and from earlier conflicts. The school must be prepared to defend itself. It must maintain connections with the broader magical community while protecting its essential independence. It must educate students not only in magical technique but in the values that make magical society worth preserving. And it must recognise that neutrality in the face of genuine evil is itself a moral choice, one that the school must be prepared to defend or abandon as circumstances require. These lessons may be tested again. When they are, Hogwarts will face the test with the accumulated wisdom of a thousand years. That wisdom will not guarantee success. But it is the best foundation on which the school can build.</p>
