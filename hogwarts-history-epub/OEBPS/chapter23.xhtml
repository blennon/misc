  <h2>Academic Traditions</h2>

  <p class="first">The Hogwarts curriculum has evolved continuously since the founder era, adding subjects, removing subjects, combining subjects, and reorganising the entire structure of magical education several times over. What students learn today bears only partial resemblance to what students learned even a century ago, and even less resemblance to the original founder-era instruction. Yet certain core principles have remained stable: the commitment to practical magical ability, the belief that students learn best by doing, and the assumption that magical knowledge should be organised into discrete, teachable subjects.</p>

  <p>The original curriculum was considerably more focused than the modern version. The founders taught what they knew: combat magic and defensive techniques, potions and healing, charms and transfiguration, and a variety of practical skills necessary for survival in a hostile world. The concept of "electives" did not exist; all students studied all subjects. The goal was not specialisation but comprehensive competence. A Hogwarts graduate of the founder era could duel, brew basic potions, cast the standard charms, and transform simple objects. They were generalists, prepared for the unpredictable challenges of magical life.</p>

  <p>Subjects were added as the school grew and as magical knowledge expanded. Astronomy, Herbology, and History of Magic all achieved independent subject status during the medieval period, having previously been taught as components of other courses. Care of Magical Creatures emerged as a distinct subject in the sixteenth century, formalising instruction that had previously been informal. Divination, Ancient Runes, and Arithmancy were added as electives during various curriculum reforms, available to students who wished to pursue them but not required of all. The modern elective system, allowing students to choose from a range of specialised subjects, dates only to the eighteenth century.</p>

  <p>Subjects have also been removed or combined over the centuries. Dueling, once a core subject taught by Gryffindor himself, was absorbed into Defense Against the Dark Arts after concerns about student injuries led to restrictions on practical combat training. Alchemy, taught at Hogwarts for several centuries, was dropped from the standard curriculum in 1741 when it was determined that true alchemical ability was too rare to justify maintaining the subject. Dark Arts, briefly taught as a subject during one particularly troubled headmastership, was eliminated and replaced with Defence Against the same, a shift in framing that spoke to changing values about what students should be prepared to do versus prepared to resist.</p>

  <p>The examination system has its own complex history. The founders did not use standardised examinations; assessment was continuous and informal, based on teachers' judgments of student ability. Formal examinations emerged gradually as the school grew and as the demand for objective credentials increased. The Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) examinations, taken at the end of a student's fifth year, were instituted in 1702 following Ministry pressure for standardised qualifications. The Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests (N.E.W.T.s), the advanced qualifications taken at the end of seventh year, followed in 1714.</p>

  <p>An earlier qualification, the Wizarding Aptitude for Necessary Disciplines (W.A.N.D.), existed briefly in the seventeenth century but was abandoned after widespread cheating and inconsistent administration rendered the results meaningless. The W.A.N.D. was meant to be a comprehensive assessment of magical ability, testing students on all subjects simultaneously rather than examining each subject separately. The concept was ambitious; the execution was disastrous. Students spent more time learning to cheat the W.A.N.D. than learning the magic it was meant to assess. The examination was quietly discontinued, and its name became a cautionary byword for educational overreach.</p>

  <p>Examination scandals have occurred periodically throughout Hogwarts history. The O.W.L. crisis of 1798 resulted in the invalidation of an entire year's examinations after it was discovered that questions had been leaked in advance. The N.E.W.T. controversy of 1889 centred on a Charms examiner who had failed students based on personal grudges rather than performance. These scandals have prompted reforms, but the examination system remains imperfect, dependent on human judgment and vulnerable to human failings.</p>

  <p>The academic calendar has evolved alongside the curriculum. The school year originally ran continuously, with students in residence year-round and breaks granted at the discretion of individual teachers. The modern calendar, with fixed terms, holidays, and a long summer break, emerged during the eighteenth century to align with growing expectations about family time and to accommodate students from farming families who were needed at home during planting and harvest. These agricultural considerations are less relevant today, but the calendar has proven resistant to change.</p>
