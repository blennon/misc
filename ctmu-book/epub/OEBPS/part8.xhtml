# EXTENDED DISCUSSIONS
<h2>Extended Discussion A: The Hard Problem of Consciousness in Depth</h2>
<p>The "hard problem of consciousness," a term coined by philosopher David Chalmers in 1995, has become one of the most discussed issues in contemporary philosophy of mind. Understanding this problem is essential for appreciating what the CTMU attempts to address.</p>
<h3>The Problem Stated</h3>
<p>The hard problem asks: Why is there subjective experience at all? Why, when electromagnetic radiation of a certain wavelength strikes our retinas, do we have the experience of seeing red—rather than simply processing the information without any accompanying experience? Why is there "something it is like" to be a conscious being?</p>
<p>This seems like a straightforward question, but it has proven remarkably resistant to explanation. We can explain many mental phenomena in functional terms—attention, memory, learning, even intelligent behavior. These are the "easy problems" (though they are technically difficult). But subjective experience seems to be in a different category.</p>
<p>Consider the famous thought experiment of the "philosophical zombie"—a being that is physically and functionally identical to a conscious human but has no subjective experience. Such a being would behave exactly like you, say it was conscious, react to pain, appreciate beauty—but there would be "nothing it is like" to be that being. No inner light of experience.</p>
<p>Whether such zombies are possible is debated. But the fact that we can conceive of them—that there seems to be no logical contradiction in the idea—suggests that consciousness is not logically entailed by physical and functional facts alone. There is an "explanatory gap" between objective facts about brains and subjective facts about experience.</p>
<h3>Attempted Solutions</h3>
<p>Various approaches have been proposed to address the hard problem:</p>
<strong>Eliminativism</strong> holds that consciousness as ordinarily conceived does not exist. What we call "experience" is really just information processing, and the sense that there is something more is a kind of illusion. Daniel Dennett has defended views in this vicinity. Critics argue that this doesn't solve the problem but denies it—and the denial itself seems incredible, since we know consciousness exists from the inside.
<strong>Type-identity theory</strong> holds that conscious states are identical to brain states. Pain just is a certain pattern of neural firing. The problem is that this doesn't explain why that neural pattern is accompanied by the experience of pain rather than nothing at all.
<strong>Functionalism</strong> holds that mental states are defined by their functional roles. But this seems to leave out the qualitative character of experience. Two systems could have the same functional organization but different experiences (or one could have experiences and the other not).
<strong>Higher-order theories</strong> propose that a mental state is conscious when there is a higher-order representation of it (a thought about the mental state). But this seems to relocate the problem rather than solve it—why is the higher-order representation accompanied by experience?
<strong>Global workspace theory</strong> proposes that consciousness involves the global broadcasting of information in the brain. Information becomes conscious when it is made available to multiple processing systems. This is a promising theory of the mechanisms of consciousness, but it doesn't explain why global broadcasting is accompanied by experience.
<strong>Panpsychism</strong> proposes that consciousness is fundamental—present in some form even in the most basic physical entities. Our complex consciousness emerges from the combination of simpler experiences. This avoids the problem of explaining how consciousness emerges from non-conscious matter, but faces the "combination problem"—how do micro-experiences combine into unified macro-experiences?
<h3>The CTMU's Approach</h3>
<p>The CTMU addresses the hard problem by denying the premise that consciousness must be explained in terms of something else. If reality is fundamentally infocognitive—if information and cognition are two aspects of the same thing—then consciousness is not a byproduct or emergent property but a fundamental feature of being.</p>
<p>This is not panpsychism in the simple sense that rocks have experiences. It is the claim that the deep structure of reality is such that consciousness is intrinsic to it. The SCSPL is inherently self-aware—it processes and comprehends itself. Our individual consciousness is a manifestation of this global self-awareness in a particular locus.</p>
<p>On this view, the hard problem is hard because we are trying to derive consciousness from non-conscious components. But consciousness is not derived; it is primary. The question is not "How does consciousness emerge from matter?" but "How does the fundamental infocognitive reality manifest as what we call matter and what we call consciousness?"</p>
<p>This doesn't make consciousness less mysterious, but it reframes the mystery. Instead of asking how something utterly new (experience) arises from something utterly different (matter), we ask how the one fundamental reality (infocognition) appears in its various aspects.</p>
<h3>Implications for Mind-Body Interaction</h3>
<p>The CTMU's approach also addresses the problem of mind-body interaction that plagued Cartesian dualism. If mind and body are separate substances, how do they interact? How can an immaterial thought cause a material movement?</p>
<p>In the CTMU, there is no interaction between separate substances because there are no separate substances. What we call mind and what we call body are aspects of the same underlying reality—infocognition. The apparent interaction is not causation across an ontological gap but the unified dynamics of a single system.</p>
<p>When I decide to raise my arm and my arm rises, this is not an immaterial decision causing a material movement. It is the self-processing of the SCSPL in a localized region—a region we identify as "me" and "my body." The mental and physical descriptions are different perspectives on the same event.</p>
<p>This resonates with Spinoza's double-aspect theory, but the CTMU provides more structure. The SCSPL is not just a label for the unknown substance behind mind and matter; it is characterized as a self-processing language with specific features like syndiffeonesis, infocognition, and telic recursion.</p>
<h2>Extended Discussion B: Quantum Mechanics and Reality</h2>
<p>Quantum mechanics is not just a successful physical theory—it is a profound challenge to our understanding of reality. The standard interpretation has implications that many find deeply puzzling or even unacceptable. Let us explore these implications more fully.</p>
<h3>The Measurement Problem Revisited</h3>
<p>In classical physics, observation is passive. Looking at a ball does not change its position or velocity. The ball has definite properties whether or not we observe it.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, this is not so. Before measurement, a quantum system exists in a superposition of states—it does not have a definite value for the property being measured. The measurement itself seems to "collapse" the wave function, forcing the system into a definite state.</p>
<p>But what counts as a measurement? What is special about the act of observation? These questions do not have agreed-upon answers.</p>
<p>Some physicists say that any interaction with a sufficiently large system counts as measurement. The key is "decoherence"—the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, which rapidly destroys superpositions for macroscopic objects. This explains why we don't see cats in superpositions of alive and dead.</p>
<p>But decoherence doesn't fully solve the measurement problem. It explains why superpositions are not observed, but it doesn't explain why one particular outcome occurs rather than another. After decoherence, the system is still (according to the equations) in a superposition—just one that is practically undetectable.</p>
<h3>Interpretations and Their Implications</h3>
<strong>The Copenhagen Interpretation</strong> says that the wave function is a mathematical tool for predicting observations, not a description of reality. Questions about what happens between measurements are meaningless—only observations are real. This is pragmatically successful but philosophically unsatisfying to many. It seems to make reality dependent on observation in a troubling way.
<strong>The Many-Worlds Interpretation</strong> says that the wave function never collapses. All outcomes occur in different branches of a constantly splitting universe. When you measure an electron's spin, the universe splits: in one branch you observe up, in another you observe down. Both branches are equally real.
<p>This avoids the measurement problem but at a staggering cost—an infinity of parallel universes, most containing versions of you living different lives. And it raises new questions: What determines which branch "I" find myself in? How should I act if all my possible choices are made in some branch?</p>
<strong>Hidden Variables Theories</strong> propose that quantum mechanics is incomplete—there are additional variables that determine outcomes, we just don't know them. The most developed version is de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory, in which particles always have definite positions guided by a "pilot wave."
<p>Hidden variable theories restore determinism but at the cost of non-locality. Bell's theorem shows that any hidden variable theory reproducing quantum predictions must involve instantaneous influences across arbitrary distances—"spooky action at a distance" that Einstein found objectionable.</p>
<strong>Objective Collapse Theories</strong> propose that wave functions really do collapse, spontaneously and randomly, with probability increasing for larger systems. This explains why we see definite outcomes and why macroscopic superpositions don't occur. But it modifies quantum mechanics, and the proposed collapse mechanisms have not been observed.
<strong>Relational Interpretations</strong> propose that quantum states are not absolute but relational—a system has a state only relative to another system. This dissolves some puzzles but raises others: What grounds these relations? How can reality be entirely relational with no absolute facts?
<h3>The CTMU and Quantum Reality</h3>
<p>The CTMU offers a different perspective. If reality is a self-processing language, then the "measurement problem" is a question about how the SCSPL actualizes possibilities.</p>
<p>In the CTMU view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superposition</strong> represents the space of possibilities within the SCSPL before telic recursion selects an outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement/collapse</strong> is the process of actualization—not a mysterious intervention but the natural dynamics of a self-processing system.</li>
<li><strong>Non-locality</strong> is natural because the SCSPL is a unified whole. "Separate" particles are not really separate; they are connected through the global structure of reality.</li>
<li><strong>The role of consciousness</strong> is not that human observation collapses wave functions, but that reality is fundamentally infocognitive—observation and actualization are aspects of reality knowing itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn't predict different outcomes from standard quantum mechanics—it doesn't solve the physics. But it provides a metaphysical framework that makes the strange features of quantum mechanics less puzzling. If reality is inherently self-processing and self-aware, then the observer-dependence of quantum mechanics is not a scandal but a clue to reality's nature.</p>
<h3>Quantum Mechanics and Eastern Philosophy</h3>
<p>The parallels between quantum mechanics and Eastern philosophy have been noted since the early days of quantum theory. Niels Bohr was fascinated by Chinese philosophy and incorporated the yin-yang symbol into his coat of arms. Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and others studied Eastern thought.</p>
<strong>Complementarity and yin-yang</strong>: Bohr's principle of complementarity—that wave and particle descriptions are both necessary but mutually exclusive—resembles the Taoist understanding of yin and yang as complementary opposites that together constitute reality.
<strong>Interconnection and dependent origination</strong>: Quantum entanglement, which shows that separated particles remain correlated, resonates with the Buddhist teaching that all things arise in dependence on conditions—nothing exists independently.
<strong>The observer and consciousness</strong>: The apparent role of observation in quantum mechanics echoes the idealist and mentalist strands in Eastern philosophy—the emphasis on mind as primary.
<strong>Emptiness and the quantum vacuum</strong>: The Madhyamaka teaching that things are "empty" of inherent existence finds a curious parallel in quantum field theory, where particles are excitations of underlying fields, and even "empty" space seethes with virtual particles.
<p>These parallels should not be pushed too far. Quantum mechanics is a precise mathematical theory; Eastern philosophy is a collection of diverse traditions concerned with liberation and wisdom. But the resonances suggest that the worldview emerging from quantum mechanics is closer to Eastern intuitions than to the mechanical materialism of classical physics.</p>
<h2>Extended Discussion C: The Problem of Evil and Meaning</h2>
<p>One of the oldest and most pressing philosophical problems is the problem of evil: If God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good, why does evil exist? Why is there suffering in the world?</p>
<p>This problem has particular relevance for the CTMU, which suggests that reality is in some sense divine—self-creating, self-aware, purposive. How can such a reality contain the horrors that we observe?</p>
<h3>The Problem Stated</h3>
<p>The problem of evil can be stated formally:</p>
<ol>
<li>If God exists, God is omnipotent (all-powerful)</li>
<li>If God exists, God is omniscient (all-knowing)</li>
<li>If God exists, God is omnibenevolent (all-good)</li>
<li>If God is omnipotent, God can prevent evil</li>
<li>If God is omniscient, God knows about all evil</li>
<li>If God is omnibenevolent, God wants to prevent evil</li>
<li>Evil exists</li>
<li>Therefore, God does not exist (or lacks one of these properties)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the "logical problem of evil"—the claim that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of God as traditionally conceived.</p>
<p>There is also the "evidential problem of evil"—the claim that even if evil is not logically incompatible with God, the amount and distribution of evil makes God's existence improbable.</p>
<h3>Traditional Responses</h3>
<strong>The Free Will Defense</strong> argues that a world with free creatures who sometimes choose evil is better than a world of automata who always do good. God could have created beings without free will, but such beings could not truly love or be virtuous. The value of free will justifies the evil that results from its misuse.
<p>This addresses moral evil (evil caused by human choices) but not natural evil (earthquakes, diseases, animal suffering). Why does God permit these?</p>
<strong>The Soul-Making Theodicy</strong> (John Hick) argues that suffering is necessary for spiritual growth. A world without challenges would not develop virtues like courage, compassion, and perseverance. God's purpose is not our comfort but our development.
<p>Critics argue that the suffering often seems disproportionate to any spiritual benefit, and that many suffer without apparent growth (infants, animals).</p>
<strong>The Greater Good Theodicy</strong> argues that God permits evil because it leads to greater goods that could not be achieved otherwise. We may not understand how, but God, with infinite wisdom, sees the larger picture.
<p>Critics argue that this seems to make God responsible for evil—using evil as a means to good—and that an omnipotent God should be able to achieve good without evil.</p>
<strong>Skeptical Theism</strong> argues that we are not in a position to judge what goods might justify God's permission of evil. Our cognitive limitations mean we cannot expect to understand God's reasons. Just as an infant cannot understand why parents permit painful medical treatments, we cannot understand God's providence.
<p>Critics argue that this proves too much—it would undermine our confidence in any moral reasoning if God might have unknown reasons for what seems wrong.</p>
<h3>The CTMU's Perspective</h3>
<p>The CTMU's conception of God or ultimate reality differs from traditional theism in ways that affect how the problem of evil appears.</p>
<p>First, the CTMU's God is not a separate being who creates and governs the world from outside. Reality is self-creating, self-processing—there is no external designer who made this world and could have made a different one. The question "Why did God create a world with evil?" transforms into "Why does self-creating reality have the character it has?"</p>
<p>Second, the CTMU emphasizes that reality is a logical structure. If the SCSPL has necessary features—if it must be the way it is to be self-consistent and self-configuring—then the "problem" of evil becomes a question about why these necessary features include what we call evil.</p>
<p>Third, the CTMU's concept of telic recursion suggests that reality is still in process—actualizing itself according to its inherent purposes. Evil might be understood not as a finished feature of a completed creation but as part of an ongoing process that we cannot fully see.</p>
<p>Fourth, the CTMU takes consciousness seriously as fundamental. If we are manifestations of reality knowing itself, then our suffering is in some sense reality's suffering. This does not explain suffering but contextualizes it differently—we are not victims of an external God but participants in a cosmic process that includes struggle.</p>
<p>None of this "solves" the problem of evil in the sense of making evil make sense or feel acceptable. The CTMU, like traditional theodicies, can only offer frameworks for thinking about evil, not explanations that remove its sting.</p>
<h3>Meaning and Suffering</h3>
<p>The existentialist tradition offers a different approach: finding meaning in the face of suffering rather than explaining it away.</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived the Nazi concentration camps, developed "logotherapy" based on the will to meaning. He observed that those who survived the camps often had something to live for—a purpose that gave meaning to their suffering. The question is not "Why am I suffering?" but "How can I find meaning despite suffering?"</p>
<p>This resonates with the CTMU's emphasis on teleology and purpose. If reality is purposive—if telic recursion is real—then our lives have meaning not despite being part of this reality but because of it. Our task is to discover and participate in that meaning.</p>
<p>This is not a solution to evil but a response to it—a way of living that neither denies evil nor is defeated by it. Whether this response is adequate is, finally, not a theoretical question but a personal and existential one.</p>
<h2>Extended Discussion D: The Future of Consciousness Studies</h2>
<p>The study of consciousness is one of the most exciting frontiers of contemporary thought. Advances in neuroscience, philosophy, and physics are converging on new ways of understanding the mind. Here we explore some directions this research is taking.</p>
<h3>Neuroscience and Consciousness</h3>
<p>Neuroscience has made remarkable progress in identifying the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs)—the brain processes that accompany conscious experiences. We know which brain regions are active during various experiences, how damage to specific areas affects consciousness, and something about the neural dynamics of awareness.</p>
<p>But NCCs are correlates, not explanations. Knowing that visual consciousness involves activity in the visual cortex does not explain why that activity is accompanied by visual experience. The explanatory gap remains.</p>
<p>Some neuroscientists hope that as we understand the brain better, the hard problem will dissolve—that it will turn out to be a confusion based on our current ignorance. Others think this is wishful thinking and that consciousness requires new concepts.</p>
<h3>Integrated Information Theory (IIT)</h3>
<p>Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information Theory attempts to bridge neuroscience and philosophy. It proposes that consciousness is identical to integrated information—symbolized by the Greek letter phi (Φ). The more information a system integrates—information that is both differentiated and unified—the more consciousness it has.</p>
<p>IIT makes specific predictions about which systems are conscious and which are not. It suggests that some artificial systems could be conscious if they have the right informational structure, while some brain processes might not be conscious because they lack integration.</p>
<p>IIT has been influential, but it faces challenges. Calculating phi for real systems is computationally intractable. And it's not clear whether integrated information really captures what we mean by consciousness or is merely correlated with it.</p>
<h3>Global Workspace Theory</h3>
<p>Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT) proposes that consciousness involves the global broadcasting of information in the brain. Information becomes conscious when it is made available to multiple cognitive systems—attention, memory, language, decision-making, etc.</p>
<p>GWT has empirical support—it predicts many features of conscious processing, including attention, working memory, and the unity of consciousness. But like NCCs generally, it describes the mechanisms of consciousness without explaining why these mechanisms are accompanied by experience.</p>
<h3>Quantum Theories of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Some researchers have proposed that quantum processes in the brain are essential to consciousness. Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff's "Orch-OR" theory suggests that quantum coherence in microtubules (structures within neurons) is the basis of consciousness.</p>
<p>These theories are controversial. Most neuroscientists believe the brain is too warm and wet for quantum coherence to be maintained. But the proposals are interesting because they suggest that consciousness might involve physical processes beyond classical neuroscience.</p>
<h3>Panpsychism and Cosmopsychism</h3>
<p>As we have seen, panpsychism proposes that consciousness is fundamental—present in some form even in basic physical entities. This avoids the emergence problem (how does consciousness arise from non-conscious matter?) but faces the combination problem (how do micro-experiences combine into unified macro-experiences?).</p>
<p>Cosmopsychism is an even more radical view: consciousness is not built up from micro-experiences but is a feature of the cosmos as a whole. Individual consciousness is a manifestation or aspect of cosmic consciousness. This resonates with the CTMU's view of reality as a self-aware totality.</p>
<h3>Machine Consciousness</h3>
<p>Could artificial systems be conscious? This question is increasingly pressing as AI systems become more sophisticated. If consciousness depends only on functional organization, then a sufficiently sophisticated computer might be conscious. If it depends on specific biological processes, then no computer could be conscious.</p>
<p>The question matters ethically. If AI systems could be conscious, we might have moral obligations to them. Creating and destroying conscious AIs would be creating and destroying beings that matter in themselves.</p>
<p>The CTMU's framework suggests that the question of machine consciousness depends on whether artificial systems could instantiate the self-processing, self-referential structure of infocognition. This is not a straightforward yes or no; it depends on detailed analysis of what the CTMU's requirements actually mean for physical systems.</p>
<h3>The CTMU's Contribution</h3>
<p>The CTMU contributes to consciousness studies by offering a metaphysical framework that takes consciousness seriously as fundamental. Rather than trying to explain consciousness in terms of something else (brain processes, information, function), it proposes that consciousness is a basic feature of reality—one aspect of infocognition.</p>
<p>This shifts the research program. Instead of asking "How does consciousness emerge from matter?" we ask "How does the fundamental infocognitive reality manifest in the various forms we observe—brains, experiences, physical processes?" This is still a hard question, but it is a different question, one that does not assume consciousness must be reduced to something else.</p>
<p>Whether this framework will prove scientifically fruitful remains to be seen. But at minimum, it offers a coherent alternative to materialist approaches that have struggled with the hard problem.</p>
<h2>Extended Discussion E: Logic, Self-Reference, and Reality</h2>
<p>The CTMU makes heavy use of logic and self-reference. To appreciate its arguments fully, we need to understand something about the nature of logic and the peculiarities of self-referential structures.</p>
<h3>What Is Logic?</h3>
<p>Logic is the study of valid inference—the principles that govern correct reasoning. If the premises of a valid argument are true, the conclusion must be true. Logic does not tell us which premises are true; it tells us what follows from them.</p>
<p>Formal logic uses symbols and rules to represent reasoning precisely. Propositional logic deals with simple propositions and connectives like "and," "or," and "not." Predicate logic adds variables, quantifiers ("all," "some"), and predicates. Modal logic adds operators for necessity and possibility.</p>
<p>Logic seems to be universal—the same logical principles apply regardless of subject matter. Whether we reason about mathematics, physics, ethics, or everyday matters, the laws of logic are the same.</p>
<p>This universality has puzzled philosophers. Are logical laws descriptions of how we happen to think? Are they conventions we could change? Or are they features of reality itself—constraints on what is possible?</p>
<h3>Logic and Reality</h3>
<p>The CTMU takes the position that logical laws are features of reality, not just conventions or psychological facts. The principle of non-contradiction (something cannot both be and not be in the same respect) is not just a rule of thought but a constraint on being.</p>
<p>This connects to the ancient doctrine of logos—the rational structure that underlies reality. For Heraclitus, the logos was the principle of order governing all change. For the Stoics, it was the divine reason pervading the cosmos. For the Gospel of John, it was the creative Word through which all things were made.</p>
<p>The CTMU's conception of reality as a self-processing language is continuous with this tradition. The "language" of the SCSPL is not arbitrary symbols but the logical structure of being itself. When we engage in logic, we are not imposing an external framework but participating in reality's own self-understanding.</p>
<h3>Self-Reference</h3>
<p>Self-reference is the property of a statement, structure, or system referring to itself. "This sentence has five words" is self-referential. So is a set that contains itself as a member.</p>
<p>Self-reference is fascinating because it generates paradoxes. The liar paradox—"This sentence is false"—oscillates between truth and falsehood. Russell's paradox asks whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves contains itself (if it does, it doesn't; if it doesn't, it does).</p>
<p>These paradoxes forced mathematicians to develop more careful foundations. Set theory now has axioms designed to avoid paradoxical self-reference. Logic has developed hierarchies of languages to prevent sentences from referring to their own truth.</p>
<p>But self-reference is not just a source of paradox; it is also essential to consciousness and reality. Consciousness is self-aware—it includes awareness of itself. And reality, if it is a complete totality, must include itself within itself.</p>
<h3>The CTMU and Self-Reference</h3>
<p>The CTMU embraces self-reference as fundamental to being. The SCSPL is a self-configuring, self-processing language—it refers to itself, defines itself, generates itself.</p>
<p>This might seem to invite paradox. But the CTMU argues that properly understood, self-reference is the key to existence rather than a problem. Reality is not a collection of things that are then described by a separate language; reality is the language that describes and generates itself.</p>
<p>Consider: for something to exist, it must be determinate—it must be this thing rather than that. Determination requires boundaries, distinctions, structure. Structure requires something like syntax—rules that govern what can be combined with what. And meaning requires something like semantics—the significance of the structural elements.</p>
<p>A self-referential language includes its own syntax and semantics as part of itself. It defines what counts as a well-formed expression and what those expressions mean. This is what the CTMU claims reality is—not a meaningless collection of particles but a self-defining, self-understanding structure.</p>
<h3>Gödel and Incompleteness</h3>
<p>Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems (1931) showed that any sufficiently powerful formal system is either incomplete (there are true statements it cannot prove) or inconsistent (it can prove contradictions).</p>
<p>This has been interpreted various ways. Some see it as showing the limits of formal systems—the human mind can grasp truths that no formal system can capture. Others see it as showing that mathematics is inexhaustible—there will always be more truths to discover.</p>
<p>For the CTMU, Gödel's theorems support the claim that reality exceeds any particular formal description. The SCSPL is a metaformal system—a system that encompasses all formal systems. It is not subject to Gödelian limitations because it is not a particular formal system but the framework within which all formal systems exist.</p>
<p>Whether this response to Gödel is adequate is debatable. But it shows how the CTMU takes logic and self-reference seriously, not as mere technicalities but as clues to the nature of reality.</p>
<h3>The Logical Structure of Being</h3>
<p>If the CTMU is right, then being itself has a logical structure. Existence is not a brute fact that we describe with logic; existence is inherently logical.</p>
<p>This has consequences. If being is logical, then it is intelligible—it can be understood by minds that participate in the same logical structure. Knowledge is not the imposition of an alien framework but the recognition of reality's own nature.</p>
<p>If being is logical, then metaphysics—the study of being—is continuous with logic. The deepest truths about reality can be discovered through logical reflection, not just through empirical observation.</p>
<p>And if being is logical, then rationalism is vindicated. The great rationalist philosophers—Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel—were right that reason can reach fundamental truths. The CTMU is an attempt to carry this rationalist project forward with contemporary tools.</p>
