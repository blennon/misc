  <p class="first">An option is the right but not the obligation to do something. Having options—even if you don't use them—is valuable. Understanding why transforms how you make decisions.</p>

  <h2>Options Have Value</h2>

  <p class="first">Consider a job offer with a deadline. If you accept immediately, you foreclose other possibilities. If you can delay your decision, you might get a better offer—or you might not, and you still have this one.</p>

  <p>The ability to wait—to keep the option open—is worth something. Not because waiting guarantees a better outcome, but because it preserves possibility. If something better appears, you can take it. If nothing does, you take what you have. Heads you win, tails you don't lose.</p>

  <p>This asymmetry is the core of optionality. Options let you capture upside while limiting downside. They benefit from good outcomes without forcing exposure to bad ones.</p>

  <h2>Asymmetric Bets</h2>

  <p class="first">The power of options becomes clear when you think about asymmetric payoffs.</p>

  <p>A lottery ticket is an option: you pay a little for a small chance at a lot. Most of the time you lose the ticket price. Occasionally you win big. The option caps your downside (what you paid) while leaving upside unlimited.</p>

  <p>A startup investment is an option: you can lose your investment, but you can't lose more. Meanwhile, if the startup succeeds, your upside is uncapped. The option structure means you can tolerate many failures for occasional massive wins.</p>

  <p>Learning a new skill is an option: you invest time and effort, which is your cost. The skill might prove useless—or it might open doors you couldn't have anticipated. The investment is capped; the potential return is not.</p>

  <p>Whenever you can structure a bet to have limited downside and unlimited or large upside, you have a valuable option.</p>

  <h2>Creating Options</h2>

  <p class="first">Options don't just appear—you can create them.</p>

  <p><strong>Build skills:</strong> Every skill is an option—a capability that might or might not prove useful. The more skills you have, the more options you have when circumstances change.</p>

  <p><strong>Build relationships:</strong> Every relationship is an option—a potential source of opportunity, help, or information. A wide network means more options.</p>

  <p><strong>Save money:</strong> Money is pure optionality. It can be converted into almost anything. The more you have, the more choices you have.</p>

  <p><strong>Stay flexible:</strong> Avoid locking yourself into positions prematurely. Keep doors open. Don't commit until you have to.</p>

  <p>Creating options has a cost—skills take time, relationships take effort, savings require foregoing spending. But the options created might be worth far more than the cost.</p>

  <h2>Preserving Options</h2>

  <p class="first">Sometimes the best move is to keep options open rather than choose.</p>

  <p>When you're uncertain about what you want or what the future holds, preserving options is often better than premature commitment. The information you gain by waiting can be more valuable than the benefit of deciding early.</p>

  <p>This doesn't mean never deciding. Options can expire. Opportunities can close. At some point, keeping options open becomes indecision. But the bias should often be toward preserving optionality, especially early in a process when uncertainty is high.</p>

  <p>When facing a decision, ask: do I need to decide now? What do I lose by waiting? What might I learn? If the cost of waiting is low and the potential information is high, wait.</p>

  <h2>Constraint Returns</h2>

  <p class="first">Optionality and constraint are in tension—but also related.</p>

  <p>Constraints reduce options. The more constrained you are, the fewer choices you have. This sounds bad, and sometimes it is. But we've also seen that constraints can be generative.</p>

  <p>The resolution: constraints eliminate options, which forces focus. Sometimes that focus is exactly what you need. Having infinite options can be paralyzing. Having three options is actionable.</p>

  <p>The art is managing the balance. Preserve options when you're uncertain and flexibility is valuable. Accept constraints when you've learned enough and focus is valuable. Don't let optionality become an excuse for avoiding commitment. Don't let commitment become an excuse for foreclosing necessary flexibility.</p>

  <h2>When to Exercise Options</h2>

  <p class="first">Having an option is one thing; knowing when to use it is another.</p>

  <p>An option that you never exercise has no real value—it was just a theoretical possibility. At some point, you have to convert optionality into action.</p>

  <p>The general principle: exercise an option when the benefit of exercising exceeds the value of keeping it open. If you have a job offer that's good enough and the option to wait isn't likely to yield something better, accept. If you have a skill and an opportunity to use it, use it.</p>

  <p>People sometimes become option-collectors, accumulating options but never deploying them. The purpose of optionality is to enable good outcomes, not to avoid ever choosing. At some point, optionality must become decision.</p>

  <h2>The Seed</h2>

  <p class="first">Optionality is the value of having choices. Options cap downside while preserving upside. You can create options through skills, relationships, resources, and flexibility. Preserving options is often wise under uncertainty—but eventually, options must be exercised.</p>

  <p>The next chapters explore the other side: trade-offs (you can't have everything), reversibility (which choices can be undone), and commitment (when burning options helps). Together they form a framework for navigating choice in a constrained world.</p>
