  <h1>Attention</h1>
  <p class="first"><em>The master resource</em></p>

  <p class="spiral-note">Building on: Selection (Chapter 14), Constraint (Chapter 4)</p>

  <hr/>

  <p class="first">Where you look determines what you see. What you attend to becomes your reality. In a world of infinite information and finite mental capacity, attention is the ultimate scarce resource—the filter through which everything else passes.</p>

  <h2>The Scarcity That Rules All Others</h2>

  <p class="first">You can make more money. You can't make more attention.</p>

  <p>Each moment, you have a limited capacity to attend. You can focus on this or that, but not everything. The constraints of attention shape what you perceive, what you think, what you remember, and ultimately who you become.</p>

  <p>Time is finite, but you can use it on many things. Attention is more constrained—you can only truly focus on one thing at once. The hour contains the same sixty minutes whether you attend to them or not. But whether you were present—truly attended—determines what the hour produced.</p>

  <h2>Attention as Selection</h2>

  <p class="first">Remember selection: some things survive the filter, others don't. Attention is a selection filter for information.</p>

  <p>An enormous amount of information reaches your senses every moment. Almost all of it is filtered out—you never consciously process it. What survives the filter is what you attend to. That selected information shapes your model of the world.</p>

  <p>This means: your view of reality is shaped by what you attended to. Two people in the same situation can come away with completely different experiences because they attended to different things.</p>

  <p>If you want to change how you see the world, change what you attend to.</p>

  <h2>The Attention Economy</h2>

  <p class="first">Others want your attention. It has value to them.</p>

  <p>Advertisers pay for your attention—literally. Media companies compete for your attention—it's what they sell. Apps are designed to capture and hold your attention—that's how they make money.</p>

  <p>You are in an attention economy whether you acknowledge it or not. Forces are competing for your attention. If you don't control where it goes, others will.</p>

  <p>This isn't paranoia—it's economics. Your attention is valuable, so it gets targeted. The question is whether you allocate it deliberately or let the loudest bidder win.</p>

  <h2>Directing Attention</h2>

  <p class="first">Agency with respect to attention means directing it deliberately.</p>

  <p><strong>Choose your inputs:</strong> What do you consume? What news, social media, content, conversations? Your inputs demand attention; choose ones worth attending to.</p>

  <p><strong>Choose your focus:</strong> When you work, do you focus on one thing or scatter across many? Deep focus produces different results than fractured attention.</p>

  <p><strong>Choose your environment:</strong> Your environment cues attention. A cluttered desk pulls attention in many directions. A designed workspace directs it.</p>

  <p><strong>Protect your attention:</strong> Interruptions shatter focus. Notifications steal attention. The default is fragmentation. Protecting attention requires active defense.</p>

  <h2>What You Attend to Grows</h2>

  <p class="first">There's an almost mystical principle: what you give attention to expands in your life.</p>

  <p>Attend to problems, and problems seem to multiply. Attend to opportunities, and opportunities seem to appear. Attend to what's wrong, and that's what you see. Attend to what's working, and you notice more of it.</p>

  <p>This isn't magic—it's selection. Your attention filters what reaches your conscious mind. Change the filter, and the world seems to change.</p>

  <p>This doesn't mean ignoring problems or being pollyannaish. It means directing attention strategically. Some problems deserve attention; attending to them helps solve them. But habitual attention to negativity without action just makes you miserable.</p>

  <h2>Constraint Returns</h2>

  <p class="first">Attention's scarcity makes it a constraint, and constraints shape possibility.</p>

  <p>Because attention is limited, you can't attend to everything. This forces choices. What will you focus on? What will you let go? The constraint of attention means that attending to one thing is inherently not-attending to others.</p>

  <p>The constraint can be generative. Because you can't do everything, you're forced to prioritize. Because you can't attend everywhere, you develop focus. The limitation creates discipline.</p>

  <p>But the constraint can also be limiting. Miss something important because you were attending elsewhere, and the opportunity is gone. The constraint is real; ignoring it doesn't help.</p>

  <h2>The Seed</h2>

  <p class="first">Attention is the master resource. Where you look determines what you see. In a world competing for your attention, directing it deliberately is an act of agency.</p>

  <p>Choose your inputs. Choose your focus. Protect your attention. What you attend to shapes your experience of reality and, ultimately, your life.</p>

  <p>The prepared mind knows that attention is scarce and treats it that way—investing it carefully, defending it from theft, directing it toward what matters.</p>
