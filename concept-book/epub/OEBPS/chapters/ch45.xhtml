  <h1>Abstraction</h1>
  <p class="first"><em>The right level of detail</em></p>

  <p class="first">Abstraction is the process of hiding detail—focusing on what matters while ignoring what doesn't. It's fundamental to thinking, so fundamental that you do it constantly without noticing.</p>

  <p>When you think of a "chair," you're abstracting over thousands of specific chairs—all different, but grouped together because they share relevant properties. When you plan a "trip," you're abstracting over countless details—tickets, routes, logistics—that can be filled in later.</p>

  <p>Abstraction isn't just simplification; it's selective attention to the features that matter for the task at hand.</p>

  <h2>Levels of Abstraction</h2>

  <p class="first">Reality can be described at multiple levels of abstraction.</p>

  <p>A computer program can be described as electrical signals, as machine code, as assembly language, as high-level code, as algorithms, or as "what the software does." Each level is an abstraction over the one below—it hides detail and exposes a simpler interface.</p>

  <p>A person can be described at the level of atoms, molecules, cells, organs, psychology, or social role. Each level is real; each is useful for different purposes.</p>

  <p>Choosing the right level of abstraction is a core skill. Too low, and you're drowning in irrelevant detail. Too high, and you're missing crucial distinctions. The right level is the one that captures what matters for your purpose while hiding what doesn't.</p>

  <h2>Leaky Abstractions</h2>

  <p class="first">All abstractions leak. The hidden details sometimes matter after all.</p>

  <p>When you abstract "travel" as "A to B," you hide the details of how—car, plane, walking. Usually this is fine. But sometimes the how matters: plane travel is exhausting in ways driving isn't. The abstraction leaked.</p>

  <p>When you abstract "performance" as "output per hour," you hide quality, sustainability, learning. Usually you know this. But sometimes you forget, and the metric leads you astray. The abstraction leaked.</p>

  <p>Every abstraction is a bet that certain details don't matter. Sometimes you're wrong. The prepared mind remembers that abstractions leak and watches for situations where hidden details surface.</p>

  <h2>Compression and Elegance</h2>

  <p class="first">Good abstraction compresses information. It lets you say more with less.</p>

  <p>A well-chosen concept compresses a vast space of possibilities into a single word. "Feedback" compresses all the loops you've encountered into one idea. "Equilibrium" compresses all the stable states. Each concept is a compression of experience.</p>

  <p>Elegance in explanation often comes from finding the right level of abstraction—the one that makes the pattern visible. Einstein's equations are elegant because they express deep truths in compact form. A good metaphor is elegant because it illuminates by abstracting the right features.</p>

  <p>Seeking elegance is often seeking the right abstraction. If your explanation is clumsy, you might be at the wrong level.</p>

  <h2>Choosing Abstraction Level</h2>

  <p class="first">How do you choose the right level?</p>

  <p><strong>Match the task.</strong> What are you trying to do? The level of abstraction should serve the purpose. Planning a trip? High abstraction. Debugging code? Low abstraction.</p>

  <p><strong>Start high, go low as needed.</strong> Often it's efficient to start with the big picture and drill down only where needed. You don't need details everywhere—only where they matter.</p>

  <p><strong>Notice when the abstraction leaks.</strong> If something isn't working, you might need a different level. Go lower if hidden details are causing problems. Go higher if you're lost in irrelevant specifics.</p>

  <p><strong>Be willing to shift.</strong> Don't get stuck at one level. The prepared mind moves up and down the abstraction hierarchy as the situation demands.</p>

  <h2>Abstraction and Communication</h2>

  <p class="first">Mismatched abstraction levels cause communication failures.</p>

  <p>You're talking strategy (high abstraction); they're worried about a specific bug (low abstraction). You're discussing feelings (high abstraction); they're debating the wording of a text (low abstraction). You're on different levels, and the conversation doesn't connect.</p>

  <p>When communication fails, check abstraction levels. Are you aligned? If not, explicitly shift. "Let's zoom out for a second..." or "Can we get concrete? What exactly happened?"</p>

  <h2>The Seed</h2>

  <p class="first">Abstraction is choosing what to hide. All thinking uses it. The skill is choosing the right level—enough detail for the task, not more. Watch for leaks. Seek elegance through compression. Shift levels as needed.</p>

  <p>The prepared mind is fluent in abstraction. It moves up and down the ladder, choosing the level that illuminates. It doesn't get stuck in detail or lost in generality. It abstracts deliberately, aware of what's hidden and ready to reveal it when needed.</p>
