  <h1>Pattern Recognition</h1>
  <p class="first"><em>Interlude</em></p>

  <hr/>

  <p class="first">We've now covered eight patterns: the five foundations (distinction, relation, change, constraint, time) and three new ones (recursion, equilibrium, threshold, selection, adaptation). Plus we've deepened feedback and emergence from their seed forms.</p>

  <p>Let's step back and see what we've built.</p>

  <h2>The Pattern Toolkit</h2>

  <p class="first"><strong>Feedback</strong> tells you that effects become causes. Look for loops—both amplifying and stabilizing. When something is growing, shrinking, or oscillating, feedback is usually involved.</p>

  <p><strong>Recursion</strong> tells you that things can be defined in terms of themselves. Look for self-reference, nesting, and fractals. When something is complex yet structured, recursion may be at work.</p>

  <p><strong>Emergence</strong> tells you that wholes have properties parts lack. Look for properties that exist only at higher levels. When you can't explain something by examining components alone, emergence is the concept.</p>

  <p><strong>Equilibrium</strong> tells you that systems tend toward stable states. Look for resting points and the forces maintaining them. When something persists despite disturbances, an equilibrium is at play.</p>

  <p><strong>Threshold</strong> tells you that gradual change can produce sudden shifts. Look for tipping points and phase transitions. When a small change produces a big effect, you've probably crossed a threshold.</p>

  <p><strong>Selection</strong> tells you that what survives has been filtered. Look for variation, differential success, and retention. When you want to explain why something persists, ask what selection produced it.</p>

  <p><strong>Adaptation</strong> tells you that systems respond to pressure. Look for ways the system might fight back or change in response to your actions. When interventions backfire, adaptation is often the culprit.</p>

  <h2>How Patterns Interact</h2>

  <p class="first">These patterns don't operate in isolation—they weave together.</p>

  <p><strong>Feedback + Equilibrium:</strong> Negative feedback creates stable equilibria. Positive feedback can push systems toward new equilibria or destroy stability entirely. Understanding the feedback structure tells you about the equilibria.</p>

  <p><strong>Selection + Adaptation:</strong> Selection is the mechanism; adaptation is the result. Selection pressure produces adaptation over time. Change the selection environment, and you change what adaptations emerge.</p>

  <p><strong>Threshold + Feedback:</strong> Positive feedback can push a system toward a threshold. Once the threshold is crossed, new feedback dynamics take over. The combination explains sudden transitions.</p>

  <p><strong>Emergence + Recursion:</strong> Emergent properties often arise from recursive interactions. The ant colony emerges from ants following rules that reference other ants. The fractal emerges from recursive self-similarity.</p>

  <p><strong>Equilibrium + Adaptation:</strong> A system in equilibrium might seem stable, but selection pressure can produce adaptations that shift the equilibrium. Today's stability contains the seeds of tomorrow's change.</p>

  <p>The power isn't in any single pattern—it's in seeing how they combine. Most interesting phenomena involve multiple patterns interacting.</p>

  <h2>Using Patterns</h2>

  <p class="first">When you encounter something you want to understand, run through the patterns as diagnostic questions:</p>

  <p><em>Is there feedback here?</em> What outputs are becoming inputs? Is the loop amplifying or stabilizing?</p>

  <p><em>Is there recursion here?</em> Does the thing contain versions of itself? Is there a base case or infinite regress?</p>

  <p><em>What's emerging?</em> What properties exist at the system level that don't exist in components? Should I zoom in or out?</p>

  <p><em>What equilibrium is this?</em> Why does it persist? Is it stable or unstable? Are there multiple possible equilibria?</p>

  <p><em>Are there thresholds nearby?</em> Could a small change produce a phase transition? Am I approaching a tipping point?</p>

  <p><em>What selection produced this?</em> What environment was it selected for? Would it survive in a different environment?</p>

  <p><em>How might this adapt?</em> If I intervene, how will the system respond? Am I vulnerable to Goodhart's Law or cobra effects?</p>

  <p>You won't always find every pattern. Sometimes only one or two are relevant. But asking the questions trains your eye to see structure where before there was just stuff happening.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>The Prepared Mind</h2>

  <p class="first">Louis Pasteur said, "Chance favors the prepared mind." Patterns prepare your mind.</p>

  <p>When you encounter a new domain—a new technology, a new organization, a new relationship, a new crisis—you don't start from zero. You bring the patterns. You ask: where's the feedback? What's the equilibrium? What selection produced this?</p>

  <p>The patterns transfer because they're abstract enough to fit many situations while specific enough to be useful. They're the recurring structures of a complex world.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

  <p class="first">The patterns tell you what tends to happen. But how do you know what's actually happening? How do you see clearly, avoid fooling yourself, update your beliefs appropriately?</p>

  <p>Part III is about reasoning—the concepts that help you think clearly in a world that's constantly trying to mislead you. Inference, probability, causation, counterfactuals, signal and noise, representation.</p>

  <p>The foundations told you what can be. The patterns told you what tends to be. The reasoning tools will tell you how to figure out what is.</p>
