  <h1>Time</h1>
  <p class="first"><em>Order matters</em></p>

  <hr/>

  <p class="first">Things don't just change—they change in a direction. There's a before and an after, and you can't swap them. This asymmetry is what we call time.</p>

  <p>We experience time so constantly that it's hard to step back and see it as a concept. But time is strange. It flows only one way. It can't be stored, only spent. It gives sequence to events, and that sequence often determines everything.</p>

  <p>This chapter plants a simple seed: order matters. When something happens shapes what it means and what it makes possible.</p>

  <h2>Sequence Changes Meaning</h2>

  <p class="first">Consider two events: a kiss and a slap. The same two events in different orders tell completely different stories. A slap then a kiss suggests reconciliation. A kiss then a slap suggests betrayal. The events are identical; the sequence makes them different.</p>

  <p>Sequence matters everywhere. In cooking, adding ingredients in the wrong order can ruin the dish. In argument, making your weakest point first can undermine the strong points that follow. In teaching, introducing concepts out of order creates confusion instead of understanding.</p>

  <p>Language itself depends on sequence. "Dog bites man" differs from "man bites dog" entirely because of order. A sentence is not just a bag of words—it's words arranged in time.</p>

  <p>When you're trying to understand something, ask: in what order did this happen? The sequence often explains what the raw facts don't.</p>

  <h2>Some Things Can't Be Rushed</h2>

  <p class="first">Certain processes require time to work. You can't speed them up by trying harder.</p>

  <p>A baby takes nine months, no matter how many people you assign to the project. Trust takes time to build; you can't manufacture it by being maximally trustworthy in a single afternoon. Learning takes time to consolidate; cramming produces worse retention than spaced practice over weeks. Grief takes time to metabolize; trying to skip stages usually just delays them.</p>

  <p>We live in a culture that celebrates speed and hacks and shortcuts. Often these work—many processes can be optimized. But some things have irreducible temporal requirements. Recognizing which is which saves a lot of frustration.</p>

  <p>When you're impatient with a process, ask: is this something I can accelerate, or something that has its own timeline? Fertility, maturation, fermentation, healing, the growth of a redwood—some things simply take the time they take.</p>

  <h2>Path Dependence</h2>

  <p class="first">Where you end up often depends on the path you took, not just where you were heading.</p>

  <p>This is path dependence: history matters. Two people aiming for the same goal who take different routes may arrive at different places—or arrive at the same place as different people, with different capabilities, relationships, and perspectives.</p>

  <p>The QWERTY keyboard layout persists not because it's optimal but because it got established first and everything was built around it. Path dependence locked it in. Many technologies, institutions, and conventions are similar—not the best possible option, but the one that happened to win the early race and became entrenched.</p>

  <p>In your own life, path dependence operates constantly. Your first job shapes your network, which shapes your second job, which shapes your options, which shapes your identity. Each step narrows some possibilities while opening others. You can't fully undo the path you've walked; you can only choose the next step from where you stand.</p>

  <p>This isn't fatalistic—it's realistic. Early choices matter more than late ones because they shape the terrain. If you're early in a process, choose carefully; the path will develop momentum.</p>

  <h2>Irreversibility</h2>

  <p class="first">Time's arrow means some things can't be undone.</p>

  <p>You can unscramble data but not an egg. You can apologize for a betrayal but not undo the betraying. You can leave a city but not unexperience having lived there. Time stamps certain changes as permanent.</p>

  <p>Irreversibility is uncomfortable. We prefer to think of decisions as experiments that can be reversed if they don't work out. And many decisions are like that. But some aren't. Recognizing the difference is crucial.</p>

  <p>When a change is reversible, you can act quickly, gather information, adjust. When a change is irreversible, caution is warranted. This is the core of the concept of reversibility we'll explore later—but it depends on time's one-way flow. Without that asymmetry, every mistake could be taken back, and decisions would matter much less.</p>

  <h2>The Compound Effect</h2>

  <p class="first">Time has a multiplier: small things accumulate into large things.</p>

  <p>A little saving each month, compounded over decades, becomes substantial wealth. A little learning each day, compounded over years, becomes expertise. A little exercise, a little kindness, a little writing—small actions barely noticeable in the moment become significant over time.</p>

  <p>This works in negative directions too. A little neglect, compounded, becomes decay. A little dishonesty becomes a corrupted character. A little overspending becomes crushing debt. The daily choice seems trivial, but time magnifies it.</p>

  <p>The compound effect is one of the most powerful forces available to you—and one of the most underused, because it requires patience. The payoff is invisible for a long time, then suddenly obvious. Most people give up during the invisible phase.</p>

  <p>If time is going to pass anyway, you might as well have it work for you. Small consistent actions in the right direction beat sporadic heroic efforts almost every time.</p>

  <h2>Now is Different</h2>

  <p class="first">The present moment has a special status. It's the only time you can act.</p>

  <p>You can remember the past and anticipate the future, but you can't change the past or act in the future. All your leverage is now. This should be obvious, yet we spend enormous mental energy living in other times—regretting what happened, anxious about what will, nostalgic for what was, fantasizing about what might be.</p>

  <p>This isn't a call to ignore past and future. Learning from the past and planning for the future are valuable. But the action happens now. The choice is made now. The writing happens now. The conversation is had now.</p>

  <p>When you're stuck in rumination about past or future, gently return to now. What can you do here? What action is available? The leverage point is always the present.</p>

  <h2>Time as Resource</h2>

  <p class="first">Unlike money or energy, time cannot be stored. It passes whether you use it or not.</p>

  <p>This makes time the ultimate scarce resource. You can earn more money, recover energy with rest, acquire new skills and possessions. You cannot acquire more time. You can only allocate the time you have.</p>

  <p>Most people undervalue their time and overvalue their money. They'll spend hours to save a few dollars, then wonder why they never have time for what matters. They'll sacrifice years to earn money they don't need to buy things that don't fulfill them.</p>

  <p>Treating time as precious—your most limited resource—reshapes priorities. "I don't have time" starts to sound like what it is: "this isn't a priority for me." That's often fine. But saying it honestly clarifies the choice.</p>

  <h2>The Seed</h2>

  <p class="first">Time is not just the backdrop for events. It's a fundamental structure that shapes everything.</p>

  <p>Sequence changes meaning. Some processes can't be rushed. The path you take affects where you arrive. Some changes can't be undone. Small things compound. The present is where action lives. And time, unlike other resources, can only be spent, never saved.</p>

  <p>This is the seed: order matters. When something happens is part of what it is. We'll return to time when we discuss reversibility, path dependence, and the dynamics of change. For now, notice the arrow. It points only one way.</p>
